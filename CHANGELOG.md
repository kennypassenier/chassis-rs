# Changelog

All notable changes to chassis-rs. Semantic versioning over two contracts
(SCOPE H3): the Rust API services call, and the shape of the files the
scaffold writes. A breaking change in either is a major and carries a
**Migration** section; `chassis release` refuses a major without one.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-05

First release: the library (features `core`, `dashboard`, `passkeys`,
`self-update`, `notify`), the `chassis` command (`new`, `sync`, `release`)
and the `inbox` example. Consumers pin `tag = "v1.0.0"`. What is proven
where, and what is deliberately not, is `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`; the
Migration notes below apply to services built against the unreleased
0.1.x tree during development.

### Migration
- Release signatures must carry the trusted comment `<repo> v<version>`
  (`scaffold/scripts/sign-release.sh` and `chassis release` do this); a
  manifest signed without it is refused as "for another version".
- A plain `http://` `update_url` needs `<P>_UPDATE_ALLOW_INSECURE=true`.
- Secrets are no longer accepted as `--token` / `--secret-key` flags: set
  `<P>_TOKEN` and `<P>_SECRET_KEY` in the environment file.
- Services install to `/opt/<name>/bin/<name>`; the generated unit's
  `ReadWritePaths` covers only that directory (S2). Move the binary and
  update `service.yml` when taking the new unit.
- `--check` and start refuse a missing or unwritable state directory.
- `render_project` takes `(active_nav, source, ctx: impl Serialize)`;
  project pages get the `Dashboard` as an axum `Extension`.

### Added (Phase 7 hardening)
- `<P>_UPDATE_PUBKEY` (trust-root override, logged and shown on the card),
  `<P>_UPDATE_ALLOW_INSECURE`, `<P>_UPDATE_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`,
  `<P>_TIMEOUT_STOP_SECS` (mirrors the unit's `TimeoutStopSec` so `--check`
  can warn).
- `rekey` subcommand: re-seal every store from `<P>_OLD_SECRET_KEY` to
  `<P>_SECRET_KEY`.
- Read-only version watch in `off` and `supervised`; the update card shows a
  newer release without installing it.
- Skip list after an autonomous rollback (`update-skip.json`): a version
  that crashed is never reinstalled by the same process (CF-3).
- Built-in `store` subsystem in `/healthz`; state-dir probe at `--check`
  and start.
- Per-client-token API rate limit (429 + Retry-After), limiter pruning.
- Startup warnings: empty `trusted_proxies` on a non-loopback listen, short
  `TimeoutStopSec`; untrusted `X-Forwarded-*` noted once on the problems
  card; the self-update mode decision logged at start.
- Security headers on every response (CSP `script-src 'self'`, nosniff,
  DENY, no-referrer); fonts vendored; no inline script in the layout.
- Scaffold: `.dockerignore`, journald drop-in, compose example with log
  rotation, `--locked` release build, read-only CI token, SHA-pinned
  actions, systemd hardening set, lockfile in the first commit.

### Fixed
- Oversized bodies on captured API routes answered with an empty body; now
  413 with the kit's JSON error (both declared and streamed bodies).
- Webhook URLs were logged in full on failure; now scheme and host only.
- The SIGTERM listener was registered after the bind; a signal in that
  window killed the process instead of draining (found by the E2E suite
  under load).
- `main.rs` template was not rustfmt-clean; `Cargo.lock` was missing from a
  new project's first commit (both found by the generated-project gates E2E).


### Added
- The kit: `core` (configuration with provenance, errors with a remedy,
  logging, request-id, `/healthz` with `version`, `/metrics`, guards,
  graceful shutdown with `Type=notify`), `dashboard` (token + session
  login, Clients with tokens and last requests, status page, kp-themes
  3.1.0), `passkeys` (WebAuthn behind a trusted TLS proxy),
  `self-update` (off / supervised / autonomous, minisign-verified,
  staged probe, link+rename swap, rollback), `notify` (per-event webhooks
  with retries and a fallback).
- The `chassis` command: `new`, `sync`, `release`, and the scaffold they
  render (CI and Release workflows, Dockerfile, golden systemd unit,
  homelab `service.yml`, hooks).
- `examples/inbox`, the example service, and `examples/minimal.rs`.
