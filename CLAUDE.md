# chassis-rs

Shared foundation for Kenny's Rust web services: a library crate with
feature flags (core, dashboard, self-update, notify) plus a `chassis`
scaffold command for everything a crate cannot carry.

This project follows the dev procedure in `~/Projects/dev-procedure/`
(`/project-flow`). Standing rules apply to every change:
`~/Projects/dev-procedure/STANDING_RULES.md`.
Enforcement is **git-native** (`.githooks/` via `core.hooksPath`), so
gates hold from any session or terminal. After a fresh clone, run:
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Procedure status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current phase | **6 · Development loop — round 5 built 2026-09-10** (rule 46, the four consumer reports, and Kenny's plug-and-play requirement). On `main`, unreleased: client fields kept by the kit, `App::project_config`, `Counter`/`Gauge`, one assembly for tests, `docs/API_SURFACE.txt` with its check, `chassis upgrade`, static musl on distroless, the build-target amendment, the Clients naming sweep, the `update_cmd` fix. Open: feat-dep-1 (an own registry, to be costed), then the Phase 10 retro of batch 3 |
| Last completed gate | Round 5 (Kenny, 2026-09-10): sixteen items, six answered with measurements first. Everything rated Onmisbaar or Allebei is built and on `main`; feat-api-2 was used immediately by the deprecated `ClientsFile::issue` |
| Next gate | The round-5 milestone report (L11). Then feat-dep-1: what an own registry costs on Kenny's infrastructure, as a separate proposal. Then the Phase 10 retro of batch 3 |
| AFK mode | **off** since 2026-09-07 (batch 3 reported). Rule 7a in force: the four consumer projects are touched only in their own sessions |
| Scratch resource | CT 118 `118-app-inbox` on 10.10.5.250, ip 10.10.10.18 — adopted by the homelab 2026-09-05 (stack `inbox`, backup only); runs inbox 0.1.3 (drill build) at /opt/inbox/bin under the hardened unit, supervised |

<!-- Update this block after every completed gate. -->

## Project documents

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| docs/SCOPE.md | goals, non-goals, success criteria, constraints (Phase 0) |
| docs/FEATURES.md | rated feature list with permanent IDs (Phase 2) |
| docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md | frozen AR decisions incl. tech choice (Phases 3-4) |
| docs/REALIZATION_PLAN.md | milestones + status table (Phase 5) |
| docs/TEST_PLAN.md | what is proven where + accepted limitations (Phase 7) |
| docs/PENDING_MINI_ROUNDS.md | ratification rounds, mini-rounds, open measurements |

## Gates (enforced)

Commits are blocked by `.claude/hooks/check-commit.sh` unless
`.claude/hooks/gates.sh` passes and the message carries IDs in
brackets (`[W12]`, `[L4b]`, `[meta]`). CI re-runs the same gates on
every push; red blocks merge.

## Context worth knowing before touching anything

- The scoping session (2026-09-05) inventoried kyu, Almanac,
  HTTPSwitchboard and kyu-runner; the decisions from it are listed at
  the end of `docs/SCOPE.md`. Almanac's `src/core/update.rs` and
  `src/shell/update.rs` are the starting code for self-update; kyu's
  `src/http/{auth,csrf,error}.rs` and `src/shutdown.rs` for the core.
- The Homelab Rust session answered eight questions about what the
  homelab expects (update_cmd contract, /healthz version field, state
  root, unit hardening); the answers are folded into SCOPE.md.
- Session title convention: `🏗️ chassis-rs - Fase <N> - <phase name>`.
